## Markdown of all the bad thing

### hi, this is a list of all the bad things in our chosen website 

[http://www.arngren.net/](http://www.arngren.net/)

  1. no updates 
  2. via ugly websites on google 
  3. this is an outdated website 
  4. Unorganized 
  5. Not user friendly 


### What to change?

  1. less pictures, more space
     * Item 1a. Like working with one seize pictures or seperate it in more tabs so you get some rest in the homepage.
  2. stucture
     * Item 2a. We mean with this that they need to work on a better composition for them website, instead having it all in corners and seizes.
  3. one color texts
     * Item 3a. They use all different colors, maybe they better don't use so much colors and keep it by max 3 colors.
